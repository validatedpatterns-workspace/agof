This repository is part of Red Hat's [Validated Patterns](https://validatedpatterns.io) effort, which in general
aims to provide Reference Architectures that can be run through CI/CD systems.

The goal of this project in particular is to provide an extensible framework to do GitOps with Ansible Automation
Platform, and as such to provide useful facilities for developing Patterns (community and validated) that function with Ansible Automation Platform as the GitOps engine.

The thinking behind this effort is documented in the [Ansible Pattern Theory](https://github.com/mhjacks/ansible-pattern-theory) repository.

## 1. <a name='Prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

- **Podman** (version 4.3.0 or later): All commands are run inside a utility container via `pattern.sh`.
- **An `~/agof_vault.yml` file**: Contains credentials, configuration variables, and secrets for the installation. See the [agof_vault.yml Configuration](#agof_vault.ymlConfiguration) section for details.
- **A Red Hat subscription**: Needed for RHEL entitlement and access to AAP content.
- **An [AAP manifest file](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files)**: Required to entitle the AAP Controller (see `manifest_content` in the configuration section).
- **An Automation Hub token**: For downloading certified and validated Ansible content from [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).
- **AWS credentials** (for the Default Install only): An AWS account with permissions to create VPCs, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances.

### About `pattern.sh`

`pattern.sh` is the main entry point for running framework commands. It is a wrapper script that launches a utility container (via podman) with your home directory mounted, ensuring a consistent and reproducible execution environment. All `make` targets are run through it, e.g. `./pattern.sh make install`.

## 2. <a name='HowtoUseIt'></a>How to Use It

The default installation will provide an AAP 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 installation (see `containerized_installer_version`) deployed via the Containerized Installer, with the following services available on the AAP node (where `aapnode.fqdn` is the fully qualified domain name of your AAP host):

| URL Pattern | Service |
|-------------|---------|
| <https://aapnode.fqdn/> | Platform gateway (default UI entry point) |
| <https://aapnode.fqdn/api/controller/v2/> | Controller API |

Automation Hub and EDA are enabled by default, but they can be turned off if desired (see the `automation_hub` and `eda` variables).

By default, the framework will apply license content specified by the `manifest_content` variable (see [obtaining a manifest file](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files)), but will not further configure Controller or Automation Hub beyond the defaults.

From there, a minimal example pattern is available to download and run [here](https://github.com/validatedpatterns-demos/agof_minimal_config.git). To use this example, set the following variables in your `agof_vault.yml`.
Any repo that can be used with the controller_configuration collection can be used as the config-as-code repo. Set `agof_cac_repo` (preferred) or the legacy `agof_iac_repo` name in your `agof_vault.yml`; when both are set, `agof_cac_repo*` takes precedence.

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://github.com/validatedpatterns-demos/agof_minimal_config.git"
# agof_cac_repo_version: main   # optional; defaults to main
```

### 2.1. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

```shell
./pattern.sh make install
```

This builds the default pattern configuration on AWS, which (by default) includes a containerized install of AAP 2.7 on a single AWS VM. Various add-ons can be included by adding variables to the `~/agof_vault.yml` file as described below - these options will all be honored as the pattern installs itself.

### 2.2. <a name='Uninstallation'></a>Uninstallation

```shell
./pattern.sh make aws_uninstall
```

This destroys all of the AWS infrastructure built for the pattern - starting with the VPC it creates for the pattern and all of the resources attached to it.

## 3. <a name='InstallationModes'></a>Installation Modes

This is a framework for building Validated Patterns that use Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) as their underlying GitOps engine. The framework supports several installation modes (listed below in increasing level of complexity). In AAP 2.5, the containerized install feature has reached General Availability and is the preferred way to install AAP on non-OpenShift environments.

### 3.1. <a name='APIInstallakaBare'></a>"API" Install (aka "Bare")

```shell
./pattern.sh make api_install
```

In this model, you provide an (already provisioned) AAP endpoint. It does not need to be entitled, it just needs to be running the AAP Controller. You supply the [manifest](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files) contents, endpoint hostname, admin username (defaults to "admin"), and admin password, and then the installation hands off to a `agof_controller_config_dir` you define. This is provided for users who have their own AAP installations on bare metal or on-prem or do not want to run on AWS. It is also useful in situations where the AAP deployment topology is more complex than what we provide in the pattern provisioner.

### 3.2. <a name='FromOSInstall'></a>"From OS" Install

```shell
./pattern.sh make from_os_install INVENTORY=(your_inventory_file)
```

In this model, you provide an inventory file with a fresh RHEL 9 installation. The workflow will use the containerized installer to install AAP on the host
in the aap_controllers group. (Many other topologies are possible with the AAP installation framework; see the Ansible Automation Platform Planning and Installation guides for details.) If you need to install a pattern on a cluster with a different topology than this, use the API install mechanism. This mechanism will run a (slightly) opinionated install of the AAP and Hub components, and will add some conveniences like default execution environments and credentials. Like the "API" install, the install will then be handed over to a `agof_controller_config_dir` you define.

The reason for making this a separate option is to make it easy for those who are not used to installing AAP to get up and running with it given a couple of VMs (or baremetal instances). Requirements for this mode are as follows:

- Must be running a version of RHEL that AAP supports
- Must be properly entitled with a RHEL subscription

It is not possible to test all possible scenarios in this mode, and we do not try.

Note that INVENTORY defaults to `~/inventory_agof` if you do not specify one.

Your inventory *must* define an `aap_controllers` group (which will be configured as the AAP node) and an `automation_hub` group which will be configured as the automation hub, if you want one. You must also specify `username` if you want it to be something besides the default 'ec2-user' (which it does not create or otherwise manage). Similarly, you should set `controller_hostname` (including the 'https://' schema) because that will default to something AWS-specific otherwise. As with all Ansible inventory files, you can set other variables here and the plays will use them.

Example `~/inventory_agof` (for just AAP, which is the default):

```ini
[build_control]
localhost

[aap_controllers]
192.168.5.207

[automation_hub]

[eda_controllers]

[aap_controllers:vars]

[automation_hub:vars]

[all:vars]
ansible_user=myuser
ansible_ssh_pass=mypass
ansible_become_pass=mypass
username=myuser
aap_hostname=192.168.5.207
```

### 3.3. <a name='DefaultInstall'></a>Default Install

```shell
./pattern.sh make install
```

In this model, you provide AWS credentials in addition to the other components needed in the "bare" install. The framework will look up a Red Hat RHEL marketplace AMI, deploy EC2 instances onto a new AWS VPC and subnet, register and bootstrap each node, and deploy AAP using the containerized installer. It will then hand over the configuration of the AAP installation to the specified `agof_controller_config_dir`.

### 3.4. <a name='ConvenienceFeaturesInstalldefinedbyoptionsinthedefaultinstall'></a>Convenience Features Install (defined by options in the "default" install)

```shell
./pattern.sh make install
```

This model builds on the Default installation by adding the options for building extra VMs besides AAP - the configured VM options include Private Automation Hub (hub), Identity Management (idm), and Satellite (satellite). The framework will configure Automation Hub in this mode, and configure AAP to use it; it will not configure idm or satellite beyond what they need to be managed by AAP. (The configuration of idm and satellite is the subject of the first pattern to use this framework.)

The variables to include builds for the extra components are all Ansible booleans that can be included in your configuration:

- `automation_hub` - Build and enable a Private Automation Hub instance
- `eda` - Build and enable an Event Driven Automation controller

Additional VM targets (such as IdM and Satellite) can be defined using the `ec2_instances_xtra` variable in the AWS-Specific Configuration section.

## 4. <a name='agof_vault.ymlConfiguration'></a>agof_vault.yml Configuration

### 4.1. <a name='CommonConfiguration'></a>Common Configuration

| Name | Description | Required | Default | Notes |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| admin_user | Admin User (for AAP and/or Hub) | false | 'admin' | |
| admin_password | Admin Password (for AAP and/or Hub) | true | | Also used to bootstrap a gateway OAuth token for config-as-code when `aap_token_vault` is not set |
| aap_token_vault | Platform gateway OAuth token for config-as-code | false | | Optional on AAP 2.5 (password fallback). Required for 2.6 and 2.7. Create in the UI under Access > Tokens or via `POST /api/gateway/v1/tokens/` |
| hub_token_vault | Automation Hub API token for config-as-code | false | | Optional; required only when your config repo defines Hub resources and bootstrap from gateway fails |
| redhat_username | Red Hat Subscriber Username (for RHEL entitlement) | true | | |
| redhat_password | Red Hat Subscriber Password (for RHEL entitlement) | true | | |
| redhat_registry_username_vault | Red Hat Registry Username (for registry.redhat.io container images) | true | | |
| redhat_registry_password_vault | Red Hat Registry Password (for registry.redhat.io container images) | true | | |
| manifest_content | Base64 encoded [Manifest](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files) to Entitle | true | | Can be loaded directly from a file using a construct like this: `"{{ lookup('file', '~/Downloads/manifest.zip') | b64encode }}"` |
| automation_hub_certified_url | URL for Certified Content | false | <https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/> | This refers to the automation hub section on [https://console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com). It is the endpoint that is used to download Certified Content in addition to any public Galaxy content needed |
| automation_hub_validated_url | URL for Validated Content | false | <https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/validated/> | This refers to the automation hub section on [https://console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com). It is the endpoint that is used to download Validated Content in addition to any public Galaxy content needed |
| automation_hub_token_vault| Subscriber-specific token for Content | true | <https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token> |
| automation_hub | Flag to build and enable Automation Hub | false | false | | Building a Private Automation Hub is necessary if your pattern builds an Execution Environment that is not hosted on a public container registry. |
| eda | Flag to build and enable Event Driven Automation controller | false | true | | |
| agof_controller_config_dir | Directory to pass to controller_configuration | false | | This directory is the key one to load all other AAP Controller configuration. The framework will populate it by checking out `agof_cac_repo` (or legacy `agof_iac_repo`) at `agof_cac_repo_version` / `agof_iac_repo_version` (default: `main`) |
| controller_launch_jobs | List of jobs to run after controller_configuration has run | false | | Use this to start a job (or jobs) that do not have aggressive schedules, and that are ready to run as soon as the controller is configured. The fewer jobs listed here the better. |

### 4.1.1. <a name='ConfigRepoAuthentication'></a>Config-as-code repository authentication (non-OpenShift)

When running AGOF outside OpenShift Validated Patterns (`make install`, `make api_install`, and similar), the framework checks out your config-as-code repository from `agof_cac_repo` / `agof_iac_repo` on the provisioner host before calling `controller_configuration`. **HTTPS URLs do not have credentials embedded in the URL unless you set one of the `agof_config_repo_https_*` variables below.** When those variables are not set, AGOF removes any existing `~/.git-credentials` file and clears the global git credential helper before checkout so public repositories clone anonymously. Private repositories require explicit vault variables or SSH.

| Name | Description | Required | Default | Notes |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------ |
| agof_cac_repo / agof_iac_repo | Git repository URL | true | | Use `https://...` or `git@host:org/repo.git` / `ssh://...` forms |
| agof_cac_repo_version / agof_iac_repo_version | Branch, tag, or commit | false | `main` | Passed to `git` as `version` |
| agof_config_repo_https_token_vault | HTTPS token (PAT, deploy token, etc.) | false | | Preferred HTTPS secret; stored in vault |
| agof_config_repo_https_password_vault | HTTPS password | false | | Alternative to token for basic auth |
| agof_config_repo_https_username | HTTPS username | false | auto | Auto: `git` (GitHub), `oauth2` (GitLab), `git` (others) when omitted |
| agof_config_repo_https_ssl_verify | Verify Git server TLS certificate | false | `true` | Set to `false` to disable TLS verification for HTTPS checkouts (lab use only; prefer installing the server CA on the provisioner) |
| agof_config_repo_ssh_private_key_vault | SSH private key PEM/OpenSSH content | false | | Written to `~/.agof/config-repo/id_ed25519` (mode `0600`) for the checkout |
| agof_config_repo_ssh_private_key_file | Path to an existing SSH private key | false | | Use instead of `*_vault` when the key is already on disk; quote paths with `~` (for example `"~/.ssh/id_ed25519"`). `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` are also detected automatically when this is omitted |
| agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host | Pin Git server host key | false | | Dict with `name` and `key` (see examples); written to `~/.agof/config-repo/known_hosts` for checkout |
| agof_config_repo_ssh_accept_hostkey | Force acceptance of unknown SSH host keys | false | `false` | Optional override; when neither `agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host` nor `~/.ssh/known_hosts` is available, host key checking is already disabled for checkout |
| agof_config_repo_ssh_extra_opts | Extra `ssh` options | false | | Example: `-p 2222` for non-standard SSH ports; appended to the options AGOF selects for host key verification |

#### SSH host key verification (`known_hosts`)

For `git@...` and `ssh://...` config repo URLs, AGOF chooses SSH host key handling in this order:

1. **`agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host` set** — AGOF writes the pinned entry to `~/.agof/config-repo/known_hosts` and uses that file with strict checking (`StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` implied by a dedicated `known_hosts` file). This is the recommended production setting.
2. **`~/.ssh/known_hosts` exists** — Used when `agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host` is not set (for example, keys prepared by an OpenShift Validated Patterns init container). Checkout uses that file with `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`.
3. **Neither source available** — Host key checking is disabled for the checkout only (`StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`). No vault variable is required for lab or first-time clones.

Obtain a host key line for option 1 with `ssh-keyscan` (prefer `ed25519`):

```bash
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 github.com
```

Set `agof_config_repo_ssh_accept_hostkey: true` only when you need to accept unknown keys despite having a `known_hosts` source configured (unusual; not recommended for production).

| agof_config_repo_http_proxy | HTTP proxy URL | false | | Applied as `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `GIT_HTTP_PROXY` when set |
| agof_config_repo_https_proxy | HTTPS proxy URL | false | | Applied as `https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `GIT_HTTPS_PROXY` when set |
| agof_config_repo_no_proxy | Bypass list for proxies | false | | Applied as `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy` |
| agof_config_repo_all_proxy | SOCKS or catch-all proxy | false | | Applied as `ALL_PROXY` when set |

#### GitHub (HTTPS + fine-grained or classic PAT)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://github.com/my-org/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_https_token_vault: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# username defaults to git (GitHub HTTPS); override only if your host requires something else
# agof_config_repo_https_username: git
```

Fine-grained PATs (`github_pat_...`) and classic PATs (`ghp_...`) both use `git` as the HTTPS username with the token as the password.

#### GitHub (SSH deploy key)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "git@github.com:my-org/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_ssh_private_key_vault: |
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  ...
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host:
  name: github.com
  key: "github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI..."
# obtain the key line with: ssh-keyscan -t ed25519 github.com
```

#### GitLab (HTTPS + project/group access token)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://gitlab.com/my-group/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_https_token_vault: "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# username defaults to oauth2 for gitlab.com hostnames
```

Self-managed GitLab:

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://gitlab.example.com/my-group/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_https_token_vault: "glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
agof_config_repo_https_username: oauth2
```

#### GitLab (SSH)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "git@gitlab.com:my-group/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_ssh_private_key_file: "~/.ssh/gitlab_agof_config"
# Host key checking is disabled automatically when no known_hosts are configured.
# For production, pin the server key:
# agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host:
#   name: gitlab.com
#   key: "gitlab.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."
```

#### Forgejo / Gitea (HTTPS + access token)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://forgejo.example.com/my-org/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_https_username: "my-gitea-user"
agof_config_repo_https_token_vault: "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
```

Gitea/Forgejo deploy tokens often use the token as the password with a fixed username; some instances expect the token alone as username with an empty password — set `agof_config_repo_https_username` and `agof_config_repo_https_password_vault` accordingly.

#### Forgejo / Gitea (SSH)

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "git@forgejo.example.com:my-org/my-pattern-config.git"
agof_cac_repo_version: main
agof_config_repo_ssh_private_key_vault: |
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  ...
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
agof_config_repo_ssh_known_host:
  name: forgejo.example.com
  key: "forgejo.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA..."
```

#### HTTP(S) proxy

```yaml
agof_config_repo_http_proxy: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
agof_config_repo_https_proxy: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
agof_config_repo_no_proxy: "localhost,127.0.0.1,.example.com"
```

#### HTTPS TLS verification

By default, AGOF validates the Git server's TLS certificate against the provisioner's system CA store. When the server uses a private CA that is not installed locally, checkout fails unless you trust that CA (recommended) or disable verification for lab use:

```yaml
agof_cac_repo: "https://git.example.com/org/pattern-config.git"
agof_config_repo_https_ssl_verify: false
```

Disabling verification applies only to the config-repo `git` checkout (via `http.sslVerify=false` in the checkout environment), not to other HTTPS calls such as AAP API requests.

On OpenShift Validated Patterns, set the same behavior in pattern Helm values as `agof.gitHttpsSslVerify: false` (chart v0.2.4+). That disables TLS verification for both the init-container AGOF clone and the config-as-code checkout.

Proxy variables are exported to the `git` process only during checkout. OpenShift Validated Patterns installs source repository coordinates from Helm values. AGOF embeds HTTPS credentials only when `agof_config_repo_https_*` vault variables are set; otherwise chart init credential files are removed before the config-repo checkout. SSH config repos still use keys under `~/.ssh/` when configured.

## 5. <a name='WhattheFrameworkDoesStep-by-Step'></a>What the Framework Does, Step-by-Step

> **Note:** The following sections describe the internal workings of the framework. They are not required reading for basic installation and usage -- see the [Installation Modes](#InstallationModes) and [Configuration](#agof_vault.ymlConfiguration) sections above for that.

### 5.1. <a name='Pre-GitOpsSteps'></a>Pre-GitOps Steps

#### 5.1.1. <a name='Pre-init'></a>Pre-init (mandatory)

Pre-initialization, for our purposes, refers to things that have to be installed on the installation workstation/provisioner node to set up the Ansible environment to deploy the rest of the pattern.

##### Build ansible.cfg

Because ansible.cfg needs to be configured with the automation hub endpoint, we generate it from a template. The ansible.cfg includes endpoints for both public and Automation Hub galaxy servers and a vault password path (for `ansible-vault`). The template used is [here](pre_init/templates/ansible.cfg.j2). The automation hub token is read from the vault and injected into the environment for the collection installation phase.

##### Collection dependency install

The next thing the pre-init play does is install dependency collections based on what's contained in [requirements.yml](requirements.yml). If there are any "special" collections contained in the root of the framework they can also be installed at this time. When the framework was under development this was necessary with redhat.satellite but the necessary changes have been upstreamed as of 3.11; 3.12 has been released since then, so this mechanism is no longer needed but is left in as it might be necessary in the future.

#### 5.1.2. <a name='EnvironmentInitialization'></a>[Environment Initialization](init_env/main.yml) (optional; enabled by default; `make install` entry point)

Environment initialization includes the steps necessary to build the environment (VMs) to install AAP and related tooling; currently the framework can do this on AWS. This step is optional if you wish to provide either an AAP controller API endpoint OR else bring your own inventory/VMs to install AAP Controller and (optionally) Automation Hub on.

##### [Initialize the Environment (for AWS)](init_env/aws/main.yml) (optional)

This play handles all the AWS-specific setup necessary to run AAP and optionally Automation Hub. It looks up the latest Red Hat RHEL marketplace AMI in the target region (or uses a pinned AMI from the vault), provisions VPC/subnet/security group infrastructure, launches EC2 instances, registers each node with Red Hat Subscription Manager, installs bootstrap packages, and creates the `aap` user with the same SSH keys as `ec2-user`.

The key roles invoked here are [manage_ec2_infra](init_env/aws/roles/manage_ec2_infra/), [manage_ec2_instances](init_env/aws/roles/manage_ec2_instances/), and [bootstrap_rhel_node](init_env/aws/roles/bootstrap_rhel_node/). Both EC2 roles have been adapted from [ansible-workshops](https://github.com/ansible/workshops). The `manage_ec2_infra` role sets up the VPC, subnet, and security group for the pattern. `manage_ec2_instances` builds the VM instances and manages Route53 DNS entries. `bootstrap_rhel_node` registers RHEL, installs packages, and prepares the AAP installer user. It is safe to run these roles repeatedly; they will not double-allocate VMs as long as the VMs are running.

These roles also include code for making hostnames durable across reboots, maintaining `/etc/hosts` on all AWS nodes in the bootstrap set, and switching SSH access to the `aap` user for subsequent install phases.

##### [Update Route53 DNS (if needed)](init_env/aws/fix_aws_dns.yml)

The standard public IPs that are offered by AWS (which are used by this framework) are not permanently associated with the VMs. When the VMs cold start, in particular, we can expect IP change events. The VMs themselves are not directly aware of their external IPs. In order to handle this situation, run `make fix_aws_dns` from the provisioner node/workstation to look up existing bootstrap instances in AWS and update the Route53 DNS mappings. This play does not provision EC2 instances or run RHEL bootstrap; it only refreshes inventory and DNS.

##### [Teardown AWS Environment](init_env/aws/teardown.yml) (`make aws_uninstall`)

The teardown play will terminate all VMs associated with a VPC and subnet, and remove the DNS entries managed by the "bootstrap set" (which are just the VMs the framework has been told it has to build).

First, we run the [Installer Prereqs](containerized_install/roles/installer_prereqs/) role. On AWS deployments the `aap` user is usually already created during environment initialization; this role ensures required packages, passwordless sudo, SSH access, and linger are configured. The sudo rule simplifies the process of running the containerized installer, and by default is removed in the cleanup stage. This role also sets `linger` on the AAP user so that services will start at boot time under the AAP user.

Next, we run the [Containerized Installer](containerized_install/roles/installer/) role. This runs the containerized installer as the designated user on a single-node all-in-one topology suitable for AAP 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 (2.7 includes the required metrics service). This user *cannot* be root (because of how it uses and configures containerized services). This role downloads and executes the installer, and also places a [manifest file](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files) (designated by the `manifest_content` variable) as `manifest.zip` to entitle the controller. It runs the containerized installer.

Finally, we run the [cleanup](containerized_install/roles/installer_cleanup/) role if it is enabled (which it is by default). This removed the sudo rule from the AAP user, and removes the manifest.zip file. The installation is now ready for you to use.

##### [AAP Configuration](configure_aap.yml) (mandatory for non-containerized install; `make api_install` entry point)

This play is really the heart and focus of this framework. The rest of the framework exists to facilitate running this play, and providing additional capabilities to the environment in which the play runs. The logic for the play is contained in the [configure_aap](agof_configure_aap/roles/configure_aap/) role. The `make api_install` entry point uses just the variables related to controller installation as desribed [here](#APIInstallakaBare). Otherwise, it is called inline from the `make install` entry point. It is safe to run multiple times.

###### Entitle AAP

The play uses the same technique and variables to entitle AAP as the role above does; but since we want to preserve the option to call it outside that role, it is duplicated. The key thing is to populate `manifest_contents` with a suitable [manifest file](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.7/html/installing_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-gateway-licensing-operator-copy#assembly-aap-obtain-manifest-files).

###### Configure AAP

Using the credentials you supply, the play will now proceed to invoke the `aap_configuration` `dispatch` role on the endpoint based on the configuration found in `controller_configuration_dir` and in your `agof_vault.yml` file. This controls all of the controller configuration. Based on the variables defined in the controller configuration, `dispatch` will call the necessary roles and modules in the right order to configure AAP to run your pattern.

If you need any jobs to be run immediately, then can be specified using the `launch_job` type as part of the AAP
configuration repo.

#### 5.1.4. <a name='OpenShiftTargets'></a>OpenShift Targets

Designed to run under OpenShift and configure an OpenShift-hosted AAP instance, AGOF has some special handling for these targets. It is meant to be used by the Validated Patterns aap-config chart, which is meant to run agof_vault.yml

The preinit steps run as they do in other contexts, setting up ansible.cfg and downloading and installing the ansible collections necessary to do the configuration of the AAP instance. The main difference is that inside OpenShift the aap-config provides Kubernetes ConfigMaps and some specific Secrets that can be used to further configure the AAP instance.
Since the OpenShift Validated Patterns experience uses HashiCorp Vault as a secret store, AGOF under OpenShift facilitates using this vault as a secret store.

Additionally, AGOF expects an agof_vault.yml file for any other secret material, which will be included in OpenShift as well. This means that you do not have to use the Vault integration if you would rather not.

Because the AGOF runner needs predictability for the existence of the manifest file and the IAC repo and revision, it overrides these specific elements from vault with its own override file, which is created as `~/agof_overrides.yml`. This file is included as the last extra_vars file on the playbook command line. It specifically sets these variables:

- `aap_entitled`: Based on examining the AAP endpoint, whether the instance has been entitled or not
- `admin_user`: Hardcoded to `admin` currently.
- `admin_password`: Has the value of the password randomly generated by the AAP Operator installation
- `aap_hostname`: The endpoint of the AAP instance, as discovered by looking for its route in the ansible-automation-platform namespace
- `agof_cac_repo` / `agof_iac_repo`: Set from Helm values (`cac_repo` preferred over legacy `iac_repo`), overriding what may be in your local `agof_vault.yml` file.
- `agof_cac_repo_version` / `agof_iac_repo_version`: Set from Helm values (`cac_revision` preferred over legacy `iac_revision`), as above.
- `agof_config_repo_https_ssl_verify`: Set from Helm value `agof.gitHttpsSslVerify` (default `true`). When `false`, TLS verification is disabled for the config-as-code HTTPS checkout.

Use `aap-config` chart **v0.3.0** or later with a compatible AGOF revision when adopting `cac_*` Helm values or SSH config repo URLs with `gitAuthSecret`. Use chart **v0.2.4** or later with a compatible AGOF revision for `agof.gitHttpsSslVerify`.
- `controller_license_src_file`: Set by creating a temporary file from the manifest file secret
- `secrets`: Special data structure that contains other elements discovered from OpenShift.
- `helm_values`: All of the helm values available to the application.

Additionally, the `agof_vault.yml` file that is passed to Vault will be used as the agof_vault.yml file inside the configuration container, so any variables set here will be usable by the framework; but any of the values listed above will be overridden by the overrides file. The goal is to provide as similar an experience as possible between the different ways of running AGOF.

Meanwhile, the helm values that have been passed into the aap-config application will be available in the `helm_values` variable.

### 5.2. <a name='GitOpsStep'></a>GitOps Step

The framework is only truly in GitOps mode once the configuration has been fully applied to the AAP controller and the AAP controller has taken responsibility for managing the environment. Prior to that point, there are many opportunities (by design) to inject non-declarative elements into the environment. Beyond that point, changes should be made to the environment or the workflows that configure it by pushing git commits to the repositories the pattern uses.

The AWS interactions come from Ansible Workshops (with some changes); the IDM and Satellite build components come from LabBuilder2/RHISbuilder. I would also like to specifically thank Mike Savage and Paul Armstrong, co-workers of mine at
Red Hat, who have provided encouragement and advice on how to proceed with various techniques in Ansible in particular.
